// There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the quality of the ith worker
// and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.
// We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
// - Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
// - In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double
// that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.
// Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.
// Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
